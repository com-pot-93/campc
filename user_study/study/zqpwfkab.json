        "description": "1. Initiation and Production Run:\r\n        The process begins by fetching the production run details from the Manufacturing Execution System (MES).\r\n        This data initiates the manufacturing process, providing necessary parameters and specifications.\r\n\r\n2. Milling Process:\r\n        Each GV12 valve-lifter is crafted from raw material using the milling machine.\r\n        Throughout this process, several metrics are continuously monitored and logged:\r\n            Vibration: Monitors the stability and performance of the milling machine.\r\n            Noise: Tracks any unusual sounds that may indicate issues with the machinery or tooling.\r\n            Energy Consumption: Measures the efficiency and operational status of machine parts.\r\n            Tool Positioning Data: Ensures precise movements and accuracy during the milling process.\r\n\r\n3. Measurement Process:\r\n        After manufacturing, each valve-lifter is transported via an independent lift to the measuring machine (KEYENCE).\r\n        The measuring machine conducts an optical measurement of the part diameter.\r\n        It generates a detailed point-cloud representation of the part's surface with an accuracy of 0.001 millimeters.\r\n        This measurement data is extensive and is stored in the process log for further analysis.\r\n\r\n4. Data Management:\r\n        Given the large volume of measurement data generated per workpiece, a data compression task is employed to efficiently store this information.\r\n        The compressed data is then stored in the process log, preserving the necessary detail for quality analysis.\r\n\r\n5. Quality Analysis:\r\n        The stored data from both the manufacturing and measurement processes are analyzed to assess the quality of each produced valve-lifter.\r\n        A critical focus of this analysis is the detection of chip formation on the workpiece surfaces.\r\n            Chip Formation Detection: Scrutinizes the collected data to identify any chips that may have formed during the milling process.\r\n            Severity Evaluation: Determines the severity of the detected chips, assessing their impact on the overall quality of the workpiece.\r\n\r\n6. Decision-Making:\r\n        Based on the analysis outcomes, the system makes informed decisions regarding the disposition of the workpieces:\r\n            Accept: Workpieces that meet quality standards with no or acceptable levels of chip formation.\r\n            Rework: Workpieces that can be corrected through additional processes.\r\n            Reject: Workpieces that fail to meet quality standards and cannot be reworked.",
