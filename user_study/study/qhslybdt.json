        "description": "Get Production run details from MES. Craft all GV12 valve-lifters from raw material with the milling machine. During this crafting the following metrics are measured: vibration, noise, energy consumption of machine parts, tool positioning. The measurements should be logged.  After manufacturing of a valve-lifter, measure it with the KEYENCE machine. The measurement data is stored in the process log, after having it compressed. From the stored data, the detection of chip formations on the surface is started. In this step its checked if chips have formand and if they deliver a risk for quality. The outcome of this analysis is crucial for deciding if the workpiece should be disposed or not.  ",
